"""Phase-2 device plumbing (the seed for a future **cell5**).

Every device used by ``main.py`` gets a context manager here that opens
it, applies safety-relevant defaults, and guarantees cleanup (heater
off, motor stopped and closed, pump port released) even when the
scenario aborts mid-run. The scenario itself stays in ``main.py`` and
only calls high-level driver methods on the yielded objects.

All drivers are the vendored copies under ``vendor/`` — no new device
code lives here.

**Planned:** this Phase-2 device composition (hotplate + smart plug +
motor + pump) is slated to become **cell5** — wrapped behind the ``Cell``
protocol (``cell/cell_protocol.py``) and served over its own ``/v1``
port, like the other cells. For now it runs as the stand-alone
``demo_scenario`` only; the context managers here are the composition
root a future ``Phase2Cell.open`` will reuse.
